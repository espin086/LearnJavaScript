# Running JavaScript

- Use a code editor and create scripts and see the console in the browser
- Other options include using codepen.io 
- Install VS Code Extensions

You can also use node to run files like this, install it from here if you don't have it [download node](https://nodejs.org/en): 

```javascript
node filename.js
```

# Comments

```javascript
var number =5; //in-line comment

/* this is a multi-line comment
*/
```

# Data Types and Variables

- undefined
- null 
- boolean 
- string
- symbol
- number
- object

```javascript
var number = 5; //number

let ourName = "freeCodeCamp"; //string

const pi = 3.14; //constant

The difference between var, let, and const: 

- var: can be used in the entire program
- let: can only be used in the scope of where it was declared
- const: is an unchangeable variable
